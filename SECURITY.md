## üõ°Ô∏è Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

The security of our users and their data is our top priority. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose security vulnerabilities.

### üìß How to Report

**Please do NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities via email:
- **Email**: security@sidebysideweb.com
- **Subject**: [SECURITY] Vulnerability Report - Payload Next.js Template

### üìã What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

1. **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
2. **Impact**: Potential impact and severity assessment
3. **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
4. **Proof of Concept**: Code, screenshots, or other evidence
5. **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue
6. **Contact Information**: How we can reach you for follow-up

### ‚ö° Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 24 hours
- **Severity Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies by severity (see below)
- **Public Disclosure**: After fix is deployed

### üö® Severity Levels

#### Critical (24-48 hours)
- Remote code execution
- Authentication bypass
- Data breach possibilities
- Privilege escalation

#### High (1-2 weeks)
- Cross-site scripting (XSS)
- SQL injection
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Sensitive data exposure

#### Medium (2-4 weeks)
- Information disclosure
- Denial of service
- Logic flaws

#### Low (1-3 months)
- Security misconfigurations
- Missing security headers
- Minor information leakage

## üîí Supported Versions

We provide security updates for the following versions:

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 1.x.x   | ‚úÖ Yes             |
| 0.x.x   | ‚ùå No (Beta only)  |

## üîß Security Best Practices

### For Developers

#### Environment Variables
```bash
# Use strong secrets
PAYLOAD_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)

# Never commit secrets
echo "*.env*" >> .gitignore

# Use different secrets per environment
PAYLOAD_SECRET_DEV=dev-secret
PAYLOAD_SECRET_PROD=prod-secret
```

#### Database Security
```bash
# Use strong passwords
# Enable SSL connections
# Restrict database access
# Regular backups with encryption
```

#### API Security
```typescript
// Input validation
import { z } from 'zod'

const schema = z.object({
  email: z.string().email(),
  message: z.string().max(1000)
})

// Rate limiting
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100 // limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
})
```

### For Deployment

#### Vercel Security
- Enable automatic HTTPS
- Set secure environment variables
- Use preview deployments for testing
- Enable branch protection
- Configure security headers

#### Monitoring
- Set up error tracking (Sentry)
- Monitor performance metrics
- Log security events
- Regular security scans

## üö´ Out of Scope

The following are generally not considered security vulnerabilities:

- Vulnerabilities in outdated browsers
- Social engineering attacks
- Physical access to devices
- Denial of service through resource exhaustion
- Issues requiring local access to the machine
- Theoretical vulnerabilities without proof of concept
